# RHSM (Red Hat Subscription Manager) credentials for setting up a new machine
# The bootstrap script makes a copy of this file, adds credentials, and encrypts it. 
#   https://github.com/nickhardiman/ansible-playbook-core/blob/main/bootstrap.sh
# Ansible credential attributes look like this.
#   rhsm_user: my_developer_user
#   rhsm_password: 'my developer password'
#   rhsm_pool_id: '0123456789abcdefg0123456789abcde'
# You can override values on the command line, as described in the README.
